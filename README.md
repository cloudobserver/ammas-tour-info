## Amma's Chair
Some of the photos (the ones in which there is blue tape on the armrests) are from 2007 so some changes have occurred since that time: 
  * The armrests are now lower.
  * The foot cushion holder has been rebuilt although the critical dimensions probably haven't changed much.

## Amma's Chair - Armrests
### The next two photos show the armrests at the current height (2019).

This old photo shows the armrests that are about 3.5 inches higher than today's chair. The chair Amma uses in Michigan has armrests at about the height shown here.

## Darshan Table -
The height of the darshan table today is higher than shown in this old photo. The current darshan table is about 3.5 or 4 inches higher. Need to check.

## Chair Blocks for Amma's Chair -
The chair blocks are placed under the feet of the chair to adjust the height of the chair during darshan according to Amma's instructions. These photos show how various combinations of blocks can be used to achieve a various chair heights. 

The small brown block adds 0.75 inch. Each of the larger yellow blocks adds 1.5 inches. 

Block combinations - 
  * One small block = 0.75 inch
  * One large block = 1.5 inch
  * One large plus one small = 2.25 inches
  * Two large blocks = 3 inches
  * Two large plus one small = 3.75 inches
  * Stiletto blocks = 4.5 inches
  * Stiletto blocks plus one small = 5.25 inches (I don't remember going this high.)

## Notes about the Chair Cushion and Foot Cushions

Dimensions of Amma's chair cushion -
  * In inches, 23.75 by 35.5 by 2
  * In centimeters, 60.3 by 90.2 by 5.1

The firmness of the chair cushion (the surface that Amma sits on) is very important but there is no standard way to quantify the firmness. We have cushions that Amma seems to like but this type of foam isnâ€™t available any more. So far, we have not found foam of equivalent firmness.

When sitting in Her darshan chair, Amma's feet are resting on one or more foot cushions. These cushions are quite firm and are constructed from layers of blue foam. The blue foam comes from sleeping pads that we buy at Walmart. Whenever the height of the chair is adjusted, it is likely that the foot cushions will also need to be adjusted soon after. This is achieved by adding or removing a "riser", a foot cushion about one inch thick. 

Example measurements - These are from years ago but still provide a rough idea.
  * Height of chair - 18 inches 
  * Height of blocks - 2.25 inches
  * Total height of sitting surface from floor - 20.25 inches
  (Height of chair plus height of blocks)
  * Height of foot cushions - 6.75 in
  * Height of sitting surface from top of foot cushions - 13.5 in

## Zip Ties for Chair Blocks -
Immediately after evening bhajans and meditation, two sevites move Amma's chair into position so darshan can begin. However due to the need to move quickly, it is not practical to position the chair blocks one at a time. Therefore we use zip ties to hold the blocks on the bottom of the chair legs. For each leg of the chair, a zip tie is inserted through holes in one or more blocks and through a hole drilled in the leg of the chair. This provides a means of temporarily attaching the blocks to the chair. Then when we carry the chair and set it down, Amma can sit immediately, no delays while setting the blocks in place. After darshan begins, within a few minutes, the zip ties should be removed because otherwise they will interfere if blocks need to be added or removed.

## Notes about Cloths for Amma's Chair -
These notes about the chair coverings may be outdated so check with Hansa for current info.

## Flower Basket for Amma's Chair -
The flower basket is attached to the shelf with magnets and is adjustable. The shelf attaches to the chair with bolts. The flower basket should be positioned as far forward as possible. This makes it easier for Amma to grab flower petals.

## Amma's Peetham -
The dimensions of the peetham increased this summer (2019) when padding was added on the top and sides. The old dimensions are -
  * Height: 13 5/8 inches (13.625")
  * Width side-to-side: 52.5 inches
  * Length front-to-back: 43.5 inches

With the added padding, the new dimensions are very roughly:
  * Height: 14.5
  * Width side-to-side: 54 inches
  * Length front-to-back: 45 inches
