## Amma's Chair - Dimensions

Amma's darshan chair, the one used for summer tour of North America, is constructed of pine. The chair can be disassembled and packed in a box for transporting between tour stops.

Some of these photos (ones in which there is blue tape on the armrests) are from 2007 so some changes have occurred since then:

* Armrests are now lower.
* Foot cushion holder has been rebuilt although critical dimensions probably haven't changed much.

## Darshan Table

![darshan table](/images/darshan_table.jpg)

## Chair Blocks

The chair blocks are placed under the feet of Amma's chair to adjust the height. Often multiple blocks are stacked together to achieve the desired height (see below). When stacked, it's important that the blocks on top don't slide off. Therefore the blocks are shaped with indentations so that they nest together when stacked.

* The small brown block adds 0.75 inch.
* Each of the larger yellow blocks adds 1.5 inches.

Heights of various block combinations -

* A. One small block = 0.75 inch
* B. One large block = 1.5 inch
* C. One large plus one small = 2.25 inches
* D. Two large blocks = 3 inches
* E. Two large plus one small = 3.75 inches
* F. Stiletto block = 4.5 inches
* G. Stiletto block plus one small = 5.25 inches
* Higher than this is not recommended due to instability

![chair blocks, increments 1, 2, and 3](/images/chair_blocks_1.jpg)

![chair blocks, increments 4, 5, and 6](/images/chair_blocks_2.jpg)

## Chair Cushion and Foot Cushions

Dimensions of Amma's chair cushion -

* Width - 23.75 inches, 60.3 cm
* Front to Back - 35.5 inches, 90.2 cm
* Thickness - 2 inches, 5.1 cm

The firmness of the chair cushion (the surface that Amma sits on) is very important but there is no standard way to quantify the firmness. We have a couple chair cushions that Amma seems to like but they are made from a type of foam that isn’t available any more. As far as we know, this type of foam, or any foam of equivalent firmness, is not currently available.

When sitting in Her darshan chair, Amma's feet rest on one or more foot cushions. These cushions are quite firm and are constructed from layers of blue foam. The blue foam comes from camping pads that are usually available at [Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ozark-Trail-Closed-Cell-Foam-Blue-Camp-Sleeping-Pad/634956813). When the height of the chair is adjusted, it is likely that the foot cushions will also be adjusted soon after. This is achieved by adding or removing a "riser", a foot cushion about one inch thick or less.

Example measurements - These are from years ago but still provide a rough idea.

* Height of chair - 18 inches
* Height of blocks - 2.25 inches
* Total height of sitting surface from floor - 20.25 inches
(Height of chair plus height of blocks)
* Height of foot cushions - 6.75 in
* Height of sitting surface from top of foot cushions - 13.5 in

## Zip Ties for Chair Blocks

Immediately after evening bhajans and meditation, two sevites move Amma's chair into position so darshan can begin. This needs to happen quickly, so it is not practical to set the chair and then add the chair blocks. Therefore we use zip ties to hold the blocks on the bottom of the chair legs. For each leg of the chair, a zip tie is inserted through holes in the block(s) and through a hole drilled in the leg of the chair. This provides a means of temporarily attaching the blocks to the chair. Then when we carry the chair and set it down, Amma can sit immediately, no delays while setting blocks in place. After darshan begins, within a few minutes, the zip ties should be removed because otherwise they will interfere if blocks need to be added or removed.

## Cloths for Amma's Chair - Notes and Dimensions

[This document](/images/chair_cloth_notes.jpg) gives dimensions and instructions for making chair cloths. Please check with Hansa for the most current information.

## Flower Basket for Amma's Chair

The flower basket is attached to the shelf with magnets and is adjustable. The shelf attaches to the chair with bolts. The flower basket should be positioned as far forward on the shelf as possible. This makes it easier for Amma to grab flower petals.

![flower basket](/images/flower_basket_1.jpg)

## Stage heater for Amma

* Optimus H-5511 Infrared Quartz Radiant Heater

![stage heater for Amma](/images/stage_heater.jpg)

This heater was really good for years. However the ones purchased recently (June 2019, June 2018) are not reliable. They work fine for awhile and then turn off for some reason. Possibly the thermostat is not working right. Swamini Amma is not happy with this heater so we need to find an alternative.

Characteristics of a good stage heater

* Small
* Unobtrusive
* Must be very quiet because it will be right next to Amma during meditation
* Must give a large amount of heat for it's size
* Usually radiant heaters more suitable than other types

## Fans

### Main darshan fans

During darshan, we always have two fans near Amma, one on each side. During Amma's summer tour, these fans are carried on the tour trucks and used in every city. The fans might not be turned on but we keep them in position, ready in case Amma asks for them.

Characteristics of a good darshan fan for Amma

* Creates strong blast of air
* Not too noisy
* Solidly built – Fans made of metal are far superior to plastic ones. Plastic fans tend to break.
* Height of fan – 56 inches (need to check). The fan should be high enough to blow over the people doing prasad seva.
* Size of fan housing (cage that covers blades) – 16 inches
* Fans that are too large are not appropriate.

Below is the preferred fan to use for Amma during darshan. This fan often becomes unavailable and out of stock for long periods. Initially the fan is too short and needs to be modified to be taller.

[Search for Hunter fans on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Dgarden&field-keywords=hunter+stand+fan)

### Other fans

During Devi Bhava, the darshan hall may become very hot and then we need two more fans on the stage, which means a total of four fans. These additional fans are positioned to cool off those coming for darshan. These fans don't need to be as tall as the main darshan fans.

On the summer tour, the tour trucks bring all four fans for the stage. However fans occasionally break down or get lost or borrowed. Or there may be a surprise request for a fan or two. So it is wise, but not required, for each city to bring two good fans to the program hall.

## Stage

Once the stage is set up, it is virtually impossible to reposition it. Therefore always check with tour coordinators for current requirements for stage length, width, height, and clearance behind the stage. Requirements can change at any time.

Sometimes the hotel has a limited amount of stage sections that are included in the rates and so we may have to accept that.

### Size and height of stage

In 2018, the most common stage size was 32 feet wide and 24 feet front to back. Typically the stage height was 36 inches. In 2019, the stages were similar except that the front-to-back distance was often less. This measurement is the most critical because, as it decreases below 24 feet, it becomes increasingly difficult to fit the Devi bhava temple on the stage.

Also the stage should be centered in the hall.

### Clearance behind the stage

Normally there should be about 9 or 10 feet between the back of the stage and the back wall of the darshan hall. This provides enough room to set up Amma's "side room" plus some additional space. (The width of the side room is about 6 feet.) The additional space allows access behind the stage so that people can walk through. However, when the hall is small, we may eliminate this access so that we can squeeze another row of chairs into the hall.

### Levelness and stability of hotel stages

At some venues, the stage may creak and shift as people walk on it. This is usually because the sections of the stage are not firmly fastened together. If it's really bad, the connections between sections should be tightened. This involves figuring out how the sections are designed to lock together. And then finding a way to fix it, including crawling underneath and maybe tightening connections with a wrench or shims.

In addition, the stage may be uneven due to sections being at slightly different heights. This can be remedied by installing shims which involves lifting the stage and inserting the shims under the legs.

## Amma's stairs

For Amma's tours of North America, we provide a special set of stairs for Amma.

![Amma's stairs - LA 11/19](/images/ammas_stairs.jpg)

## Stage carpets

Each city is required to provide stage carpets ("the red carpets"). This includes installing and taping the carpets onto the stage. The carpets should be on the stage before the trucks arrive. Arranging and taping the carpets takes hours.

(Add detailed taping instructions)

The red carpets are the base layer. Nicer fancier carpets are taped on top of them in the area under and around Amma's chair.

In most cases, the red carpets have a knap which means that the tiny strands in the carpet are all oriented in a certain direction. When the red carpets are oriented with the knap running in the correct direction, the second layer of carpets will tend to remain flat and not wrinkle. It's hard to explain so I need to make a video.

![Stage with carpets in place - LA](/images/red_carpets_LA_2015.jpg)
![Stage with carpets in place - Everett](/images/red_carpets_everett.jpg)
![Stage with carpets in place - Chicago](/images/red_carpets_chicago.jpg)

### Color

We recommend carpets that are some shade of red or ruby. Other colors may also be acceptable. Each city can select the color and thickness of the carpet.

### Thickness

In most cases, the thickness of the red carpets is "30 ounce". A thinner carpet may be sufficient, and is definitely less expensive and easier to transport and store. However if the carpet is too thin, it may become wrinkled in front of Amma's chair during darshan which is a safety hazard. Also thin carpets may wear out quickly.

### TLDR - Experiment with thin black carpets

In 2015 at the DC programs, the stage was covered with a thin black carpet. The carpet came included with the rented stage. On top of the black carpet, I simply taped the darshan carpets, the nicer ones that go under and around Amma's chair. Due to black color and reduced thickness, I expected complaints but never heard any.

These black carpets were 12 feet wide in continuous pieces across the stage (32 feet) with quite a bit of overlap and were taped to the stage. Using large pieces of carpet (12 feet by 32 feet) is a huge advantage because much less gaffers tape is needed, saving money.

These carpets didn't get wrinkled during four programs over two days, probably due to being larger pieces and due to having a large number of chairs holding them in place.

![Black stage carpets - DC 2015](/images/stage_w_black_carpet.jpg)

## Gaffers Tape and Taping the Stage

For each venue, the local devotees need to provide tape for taping the carpets to the stage. To tape the stage requires about 8 rolls of 3 inch red gaffers tape, "Pro Gaff" brand. More rolls of tape will be required if the stage is large or if the carpets are smaller and more numerous.

Besides the first 8 rolls, if the stage needs to be re-taped for any reason, more tape will be needed. For example, if the program needs to be relocated from one ballroom to another, the stage will need to be set up and re-taped again, which takes 8 more rolls of tape. Another example is when the carpet becomes wrinkled during darshan. Then some of the carpets need to be re-taped. The amount of tape depends on the extent of the problem. If the stage needs to be made smaller, such as when setting up for Devi bhava, some re-taping will be necessary, thus more tape will be needed.

The gaffers tape must be "Pro Gaff" brand and 3 inches wide and RED. Other brands are not acceptable due prior experience of tape residue embedding into the carpets.

[Good place to buy red gaffers tape](http://www.thetapeworks.com/tape/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=67)

The local devotees also need to provide 2 rolls of 1 inch wide "Pro Gaff" brand gaffers tape for marking the darshan lines. This is for Hansa. It has to be "Pro Gaff" brand and 1 inch wide and white. Other brands are not acceptable.

[Good place to buy white gaffers tape for darshan lines](http://www.thetapeworks.com/tape/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=42)

This does not include tape for other purposes such as taping the skirt on the front of the stage or taping electrical wires.

## Amma's Side Room

At each venue, we provide a resting room for Amma in case She wants a break. This room is known as the "side room" or "Amma's room". The room should be made of material that blocks most sound.

Interior dimensions (estimated) -

* Width - 6 feet
* Length - 9 feet
* Height - 6.5 feet

For the summer tour, Amma's room consists of a set of panels. They are disassembled for transportation. It is lightweight, easy to assemble, and can be transported with minimal damage. It was designed and built by Jebron.

![Amma's side room - 2019](/images/ammas_room.jpg)

### Furnishings for side room

The room should be furnished with a nice carpet, lighting, and a small table (check dimensions). Check with Hansa for details.

### Cheaper version of side room

For a room that doesn't need to be transported constantly between venues, a simpler less expensive version is advised. For example, at Amma's programs in Michigan, they built a room from standard insulation panels purchased at Home Depot. They cut the panels to size and taped them together with foil tape.

The panels are made of extruded polystyrene (XPS) and are typically pink. They come in 4 by 8 foot sheets and should be at least 2 inches thick. They are extremely lightweight and seem to block the sound well enough.

## Stage Lighting

Most often two stages lights are provided by Amrita TV (one on each side of the stage) to supplement the lighting provided by the hotel or other venue.

![Amrita TV stage light](/images/stage_light.jpg)
