## Amma's Chair
Amma's darshan chair is constructed of pine, at least that's my guess.

Some of these photos (the ones in which there is blue tape on the armrests) are from 2007 so some changes have occurred since then: 
  * Armrests are now lower.
  * Foot cushion holder has been rebuilt although critical dimensions probably haven't changed much.

This old photo (below) shows armrests that are about 3.5 inches higher than on today's chair. The chair Amma uses in Michigan has armrests at this higher position.

## Darshan Table -
The height of the darshan table today is higher than shown in this old photo. The current darshan table is about 3.5 or 4 inches higher. Need to check.

## Chair Blocks for Amma's Chair -
The chair blocks are placed under the feet of the chair to adjust the height of the chair during darshan according to Amma's instructions. These photos show the various combinations of blocks that we use to achieve various chair heights. 

The small brown block adds 0.75 inch. Each of the larger yellow blocks adds 1.5 inches. 

Block combinations - 
  * One small block = 0.75 inch
  * One large block = 1.5 inch
  * One large plus one small = 2.25 inches
  * Two large blocks = 3 inches
  * Two large plus one small = 3.75 inches
  * Stiletto block = 4.5 inches
  * Stiletto block plus one small = 5.25 inches (I don't remember going this high.)

## Notes about the Chair Cushion and Foot Cushions

Dimensions of Amma's chair cushion -
  * Inches - 23.75 by 35.5 by 2
  * Centimeters - 60.3 by 90.2 by 5.1

The firmness of the chair cushion (the surface that Amma sits on) is very important but there is no standard way to quantify the firmness. We have cushions that Amma seems to like but this type of foam isn’t available any more. So far, we have not found foam of equivalent firmness.

When sitting in Her darshan chair, Amma's feet are resting on one or more foot cushions. These cushions are quite firm and are constructed from layers of blue foam. The blue foam comes from camping pads that we buy at Walmart. When the height of the chair is adjusted, it is likely that the foot cushions will also be adjusted soon after. This is achieved by adding or removing a "riser", a foot cushion about one inch thick or less. 

Example measurements - These are from years ago but still provide a rough idea.
  * Height of chair - 18 inches 
  * Height of blocks - 2.25 inches
  * Total height of sitting surface from floor - 20.25 inches
  (Height of chair plus height of blocks)
  * Height of foot cushions - 6.75 in
  * Height of sitting surface from top of foot cushions - 13.5 in

## Zip Ties for Chair Blocks -
Immediately after evening bhajans and meditation, two sevites move Amma's chair into position so darshan can begin. This needs to happen quickly, so it is not practical to set the chair and then add the chair blocks. Therefore we use zip ties to hold the blocks on the bottom of the chair legs. For each leg of the chair, a zip tie is inserted through holes in the block(s) and through a hole drilled in the leg of the chair. This provides a means of temporarily attaching the blocks to the chair. Then when we carry the chair and set it down, Amma can sit immediately, no delays while setting blocks in place. After darshan begins, within a few minutes, the zip ties should be removed because otherwise they will interfere if blocks need to be added or removed.

## Notes about Cloths for Amma's Chair -
These notes about the chair coverings may be outdated so check with Hansa for current info.

## Flower Basket for Amma's Chair -
The flower basket is attached to the shelf with magnets and is adjustable. The shelf attaches to the chair with bolts. The flower basket should be positioned as far forward as possible. This makes it easier for Amma to grab flower petals.

## Fans
### Main darshan fans
During darshan, we always have two fans near Amma, one on each side. During Amma's summer tour, these fans are carried on the tour trucks and used in every city. The fans might not be turned on but we keep them in position, ready in case Amma asks for them. 

Characteristics of a good darshan fan for Amma

  * Creates strong blast of air
  * Not too noisy
  * Solidly built – Fans made of metal are far superior to plastic ones. Plastic fans tend to break. 
  * Height of fan – 56 inches (need to check if this is current). The fan should be high enough to blow over the people doing prasad seva. 
  * Size of fan housing (cage that covers blades) – 16 inches
  * Fans that are too large are not appropriate.

Below is the current version of the darshan fan for Amma. This fan often becomes unavailable for long periods. Initially the fan is too short and needs to be modified to be taller.

### Other fans
During Devi Bhava, the darshan hall may become very hot and then we need two more fans on the stage, which means a total of four fans. These additional fans are positioned to cool off those coming for darshan. These fans don't need to be as tall as the main darshan fans. 

As of summer tour 2019, the tour trucks bring all four fans for the stage. However fans occasionally break down or get lost or borrowed. Or there may be a surprise request for a fan. So it is wise, but not required, for each city to bring two good fans to the program hall.

## Stage

### Size and Height of stage

Ask Amrita Priya for the current recommended size and height for the stage. Sometimes the hotel has a certain size stage and that's what we get.

In 2018, the most common stage size was 32 feet wide and 24 feet front to back. The front-to-back measurement is the most critical. In 2019, the stages were often less than 24 feet front-to-back. In that case, there is barely enough room on the stage for the Devi bhava temple. This is becoming the new normal. 

The height of the stage should be around 36 inches (not sure, check with AP). 

The stage should be centered in the hall. Once the stage is set up, it is virtually impossible to reposition it.

### Extra space behind the stage

Check with Amrita Priya for the current requirement. 

Normally there should be about 9 or 10 feet between the back of the stage and the back wall of the darshan hall. This provides enough room to set up Amma's "side room" in that area. The room is about 6 feet 6 inches wide (not sure). Also we prefer to have additional space for access behind the stage so that people can walk through. However, when the hall is small, we may eliminate this access so that we can squeeze in another row of chairs in the hall. 

### Levelness and stability of hotel stages

At some venues, the stage may shift when people walk on it because the sections are not firmly fastened together. If the stage is too shaky, the connections between the sections should be tightened. This involves figuring out how the sections are designed to lock together. And then finding a way to fix it, including crawling underneath and maybe tightening connections with a wrench. 

In addition, the stage may be uneven due to sections being at slightly different heights. This can be remedied by installing shims which involves lifting the stage and inserting the shims.

## Stage carpets

Each city is required to provide stage carpets (aka "the red carpets"). This includes installing and taping the carpets onto the stage. The carpets should be on the stage before the trucks arrive. Arranging and taping the carpets takes hours. It requires about 8 rolls of 3 inch red gaffers tape. The amount of tape depends on the size of stage and the number of carpet sections.

The red carpets are the base layer. Nicer fancier carpets are taped on top of them in the area under and around Amma's chair.

![Stage with carpets in place - Everett](/images/red_carpets_everett.jpg)
![Stage with carpets in place - Chicago](/images/red_carpets_chicago.jpg)

### Color

We recommend carpets that are some shade of red or ruby. Other colors may also be acceptable. Each city can select the color and thickness of the carpet. 

### Thickness

Most commonly the thickness of the red carpets is "30 ounce". A thinner carpet may be sufficient, and is definitely less expensive and easier to transport and store. However if the carpet is too thin, it may become wrinkled right in front of Amma's chair during darshan which is a safety hazard. Also thin carpets may wear out quickly.

### TMI - Experiment with thin black carpets -

In 2015 at the DC programs, the stage was covered with a thin black carpet. The carpet came included with the rented stage. On top of the black carpet, I simply taped the darshan carpets, the nicer ones that go under and around Amma's chair. Due to black color and reduced thickness, I expected complaints but never heard any. 

These black carpets were 12 feet wide in continuous pieces across the stage (32 feet) with quite a bit of overlap and were taped to the stage. Using large pieces of carpet (12 feet by 32 feet) is a huge advantage because much less gaffers tape is needed, saving money.

These carpets didn't get wrinkled during four programs over two days, probably due to being larger pieces and due to having a large number of chairs holding it in place.
